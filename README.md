# BatikIn

BatikIn is an Android application developed by Capstone Team C23-PS257. The main purpose of BatikIn is to scan and identify batik motifs. The app allows users to capture an image of a batik fabric or pattern and provides information about the specific batik motif.

## Features

- Scan Batik Motifs: Users can use the app to scan and identify batik motifs by capturing an image of a batik fabric or pattern.
- Motif Identification: BatikIn utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the scanned image and identify the specific batik motif.
- Motif Information: The app provides detailed information about the description of the batik motif.
- E-commerce Integration: In the future, BatikIn aims to become an e-commerce platform where users can purchase batik fabrics and products directly from the app.

## Development Team

- Team Name: C23-PS257
- Members: list team member

## Technologies Used

- Android Studio: The app is developed using Android Studio, the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- Kotlin: The programming language used for developing the Android app.
- Jetpack Compose: Modern toolkit for building native Android UI using a declarative approach. Jetpack compose offers a more efficient and flexible way to create UI compared to traditional Android XML layouts.
- Machine Learning: The Machine Learning model uses the TensorFlow framework, which incorporates various processes such as data augmentation, transfer learning using the MobileNetV3 base model, and a model with 7 layers. The layers consist of a base_model, 3 dense layers, 2 dropout layers, and 1 Flatten layer. The model utilizes the Adam optimizer and the categorical_crossentropy loss function.
- Cloud Computing: the using API from google cloud.....
  
## Future Plans

In the future, the BatikIn team plans to further enhance the application by implementing the following features:

- E-commerce Functionality: Integrate an e-commerce platform within the app, allowing users to purchase batik fabrics and products directly.
- User Profiles: Implement user profiles to enable personalized recommendations and a seamless shopping experience.
- Dark mode: Implement dark mode in order to make better user experience
